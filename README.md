![SKILL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95a34001-d60d-41a0-b147-32492b2d69d5)

Vision
The Course Completion Badge smart contract aims to provide a decentralized and verifiable way to issue digital badges for course completions.
This contract ensures that badges are uniquely minted for each course and securely associated with their respective recipients. 
By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to offer a tamper-proof and transparent certification system that can be easily integrated into educational platforms.
